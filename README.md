# sds-2.2
NOTE: I had a problem with my keyboard (some of the key caps have fallen off but I still got the essay in on time!) so here are some breif comments on the code
\nThe first box: All libraries that will be used imported in the beginning 
\n2nd box : reimporting (?) matplotlib because I had some issues
\n3 and 4th box: The london pubs and LSOA data being downloaded and moved the right folder (unzipped too!)
\n5th box: more libraries being imported
\n6 and 7th box: looking at the LSOA data and polygons and points within the data (how many there are)
\n8th box: plotting the pub points in London
\n9th box : more plotting of pub points in London and saving them as pngs
\n10-13th boxes: quadrant and chi squared test to see if pub points are random or not
\n14-18th boxes: merging data and plotting a map
\n19th box: Plotting the density of pub points in London
\n20 and 21st boxes: I tried to alter the spread (histogram bins) of the data - didn't work.
\n22nd: Attempt at changing legends by trying an example - also didn't work.
\n23rd: importing bokeh
\n24th: the geometry of the pub points are being reprojected
\n25th: brief 'is this notebook still working' intermission
\n26th: sns jointplot of bivariate densities of pub points
\n27th: 2d kernel plot
\n28th: another bivariate density plot
\n29th: trying out the geometry thing again 
\n30th: yet another 'please work mr notebook' intermission
\n31st: trying something new but it didn't work too
