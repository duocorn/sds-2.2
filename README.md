# sds-2.2
NOTE: I had a problem with importing the notebook with all the comments so here are some comments on the code

The first box: All libraries that will be used imported in the beginning 

2nd box : reimporting (?) matplotlib because I had some issues

3 and 4th box: The london pubs and LSOA data being downloaded and moved the right folder (unzipped too!)

5th box: more libraries being imported

6 and 7th box: looking at the LSOA data and polygons and points within the data (how many there are)

8th box: plotting the pub points in London

9th box : more plotting of pub points in London and saving them as pngs

10-13th boxes: quadrant and chi squared test to see if pub points are random or not

14-18th boxes: merging data and plotting a map

19th box: Plotting the density of pub points in London

20 and 21st boxes: I tried to alter the spread (histogram bins) of the data - didn't work.

22nd: Attempt at changing legends by trying an example - also didn't work.

23rd: importing bokeh

24th: the geometry of the pub points are being reprojected

25th: brief 'is this notebook still working' intermission

26th: sns jointplot of bivariate densities of pub points

27th: 2d kernel plot

28th: another bivariate density plot

29th: trying out the geometry thing again 

30th: yet another 'please work mr notebook' intermission

31st: trying something new but it didn't work too
